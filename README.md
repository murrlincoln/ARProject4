# AR Browser for Vanderbilt Campus

## Project Description

This project aims to create an augmented reality (AR) browser application for the Vanderbilt University campus and surrounding area. By overlaying digital content in the real-world environment, the app will provide an interactive and informative experience for students, faculty, staff, and visitors.

### Key features of the AR browser will include:

- Marking some popular Vandy Van bus routes, WeGo routes, buildings, points of interest, and statues
- Providing maintenance call buttons or other relevant features on a per-building basis
- Displaying information about landmarks, statues, and other points of interest
- Offering an AR experience of the campus

The application will be developed using the Unity game engine combined with the Vuforia or Google ARCore SDK for image recognition capabilities. If Vuforia is chosen, the app will utilize Vuforia's image targeting feature to recognize and track specific images, such as building facades or landmarks. The Unity development environment will be used to create the AR scenes, user interface, and interactions.

In addition to image recognition, the project will explore using GPS and geofencing features to create location-based AR experiences. This will involve integrating Unity with the device's GPS and location services to trigger AR content based on the user's position. Google's geofencing API stands out as the current front-runner for making this happen.

The application will be developed primarily for Windows devices, as I do not have access to an Android phone. However, I also plan to explore if this would be possible in the browser.

This project aims to showcase the potential of AR technology in enhancing the campus experience by providing users with real-time, context-aware information and interactive features. By leveraging the capabilities of Unity, Vuforia (or ARCore), and GPS integration, the AR campus viewer will serve as a valuable tool for navigating and exploring the Vanderbilt campus, making it easier for users to access relevant information and engage with their surroundings.

My final deliverables will include the code used to create the AR campus representation, a video demonstrating its function, and the AR objects themselves, which will have information about buildings, bus routes, statues, etc. and action items where applicable.
